//Main Logic Part

//So I is analogous to n and j is analogous to W. Ok so the as soon as you encounter a value weight that is <= W is w[i-1]<=j i.e. w[n-1]<=W we will now make a choice to either include the element in our bag or discard it. So if we include then we will take it out v[i-1], add it with the previously stored value, decrease the element count t[i-1] and subtract the max capacity by the weight we just added i.e. t[i-1][j-w[i-1]]. Now if we donâ€™t wish to include that then we will decrease the element count, t[i-1] but not subtract the Max capacity since we are not including the item in our sack i.e. t[i-1][j-0]

			     t[i][j]=Math.max(v[i-1]+t[i-1][j-w[i-1]], 0+t[i-1][j-0]);
					
				}
//ofc if the weight is > W then we cant add it hence the else part

			else {
				t[i][j]=t[i-1][j-0];
			      }
			}
		}

//the final answer will be stored in the last cell in the matrix coz in the last cell i=n,j= W i.e. all the elements have been processed
